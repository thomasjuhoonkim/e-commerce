### Overview

Here is my fully functional e-commerce website! Its caled Thomas' IKEA Store and it has some best selling IKEA products in the product list. You can go through the entire user experience cycle: browsing, adding to cart, adjusting the cart, checkout, and payment with email confirmations and fulfillment!

### Technicals

- I used React for the frontend paired with Material UI to simplify and expedite the styling.
- I used commerce.js in order to simplify the backend and focus on the funcationality and experience of the website.
- Stripe was used as the payment system. All payment capabilities were processed in sandbox mode to prevent myself from going broke.

### Struggles

- React state management was difficult. Thinking about where to instantiate certain states were difficult as I didn't know where else I might need them down the line.
- JavaScript Async/Await was finicky at times and I had to add a lot of conditionals before certain components rendered.
- Modularizing certain components such as checkout forms were difficult, shipping rates are dependent on areas and areas are dependant on the shipping country. Making separate reusable input components didn't make sense as there were many dependencies.

### Successes

- I worked with way too much React, I have so much to learn and yet I feel I know so much.
- API was very user friendly and allowed me to render and update components very easily.
- Learned Material UI a lot more in-depth and learned to visualize css faster.
